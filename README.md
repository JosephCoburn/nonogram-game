# Nonogram Game
#### Description
*Nonograms were created in 1987 by Japanese designer Non Ishida, when she won a design competition by illuminating specific rooms in a skyscraper to create an image. The resulting paper puzzles Ishida created became popularized in 1990 through their regular inclusion in the British newspaper, "The Sunday Telegraph". Nonograms are also commonly known as Griddlers or Picross. One early example of these puzzles in popular culture was Nintendo's 1995 release of "Mario's Picross" for Game Boy.*
